**4. Entity Relationship Diagram**
Based on the requirements described above, the following entity relationship diagram
represents the key entities and their relationships in the Employee Recruitment System:
```
+-------------------+
| JobVacancy |
+-------------------+
| VacancyID (PK) |
| JobTitle |
| Description |
| Qualifications |
| Status |
+-------------------+
|
|
| 1
|
|
+-------------------+
| Application |
+-------------------+
| ApplicationID (PK)|
| VacancyID (FK) |
| ApplicantName |
| ContactInfo |
| WorkExperience |
| Education |
| Resume/CV |
| Status |
+-------------------+
|
|
| 1
|
|
+-------------------+
| Interview |
+-------------------+
| InterviewID (PK) |
| ApplicationID (FK)|
| InterviewDate |
| InterviewTime |
| Interviewer |
| Notes |
+-------------------+
```
In the diagram:
- (PK) denotes the primary key of the entity.
- (FK) denotes the foreign key referencing the primary key of another entity.
The relationships between the entities are as follows:
- Each "JobVacancy" can have multiple "Applications" (one-to-many relationship).
- Each "Application" can have multiple "Interviews" (one-to-many relationship).
**5. Pictorial Representation**
Here's a pictorial representation connecting the tables based on the relationships:
```
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
| JobVacancy | | Application | | Interview |
+-----------------+ +-----------------+ +-----------------+
| VacancyID (PK) | | ApplicationID | | InterviewID (PK)|
| JobTitle | | VacancyID (FK) | | ApplicationID |
| Description | | ApplicantName | | InterviewDate |
| Qualifications | 1 N | ContactInfo | 1 N | InterviewTime |
| Status | ------ | WorkExperience | ------ | Interviewer |
+-----------------+ | Education | | Notes |
| Resume/CV | +-----------------+
| Status |
+-----------------+
```
The diagram shows the relationships between the "JobVacancy," "Application," and "Interview"
entities. Each relationship is labeled with the cardinality (1 to N) and the corresponding foreign
key (FK). This pictorial representation provides a visual overview of how the tables are
connected in the Employee Recruitment System.
