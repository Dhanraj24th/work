**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Online Project
Management System**
1. **Introduction**
1. Purpose: The purpose of the online project management system is to provide a
collaborative platform for managing and tracking projects, tasks, resources, and timelines.
2. Scope: The system will allow users to create projects, assign tasks to team members,
monitor progress, allocate resources, and generate reports. It will provide features for task
management, document sharing, communication, and scheduling.
3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: None
2. **System Overview**
1. System Architecture: The system will be a web-based application built using a three-tier
architecture (presentation layer, application layer, and data layer).
2. System Interfaces: The system will have interfaces for project managers, team members,
and administrators.
3. User Characteristics: The system will cater to project managers who create and manage
projects, team members who work on tasks, and administrators who manage system settings
and user roles.
4. Constraints: The system should be user-friendly, scalable, and support multiple concurrent
users.
3. **Functional Requirements**
1. User Registration and Login
- Users should be able to register an account with the system by providing their details.
- Users should be able to log in to their accounts using their credentials.
2. Project Management
- Project managers should be able to create new projects and define project details such as
title, description, start date, end date, and priority.
- Project managers should be able to assign team members to projects.
- Project managers should be able to track project progress and update status.
3. Task Management
- Project managers should be able to create tasks within projects and assign them to team
members.
- Team members should be able to view their assigned tasks and update their status.
- Task dependencies and priorities should be defined and managed.
4. Resource Allocation
- Project managers should be able to allocate resources (e.g., equipment, materials, or team
members) to tasks.
- Resource availability and utilization should be tracked.
5. Document Sharing
- Users should be able to upload and share project-related documents and files.
- Version control and document access control should be implemented.
6. Communication
- Users should be able to communicate with team members through messages, comments,
or discussion threads.
- Notifications and email alerts should be sent for important updates.
7. Scheduling and Calendar
- Users should be able to schedule project-related events, meetings, or milestones.
- A shared calendar should display important dates and deadlines.
8. Reporting and Analytics
- The system should provide reports on project status, task completion, resource utilization,
and milestones achieved.
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. Usability: The system should have an intuitive user interface with easy navigation and clear
instructions.
2. Performance: The system should be responsive and handle multiple concurrent users
efficiently.
3. Security: The system should implement secure authentication, role-based access control,
and data encryption.
4. Reliability: The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime for maintenance.
5. Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of users, projects,
and tasks.
6. Compatibility: The system should be compatible with major web browsers and devices.
