Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an online ticket booking
system and provide entity diagrams to illustrate the system's entities and their relationships.
Let's start with the SRS.
**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Online Ticket Booking System**
1. **Introduction**
1. Purpose: The purpose of the online ticket booking system is to provide a convenient and
efficient platform for users to book tickets for various events or services.
2. Scope: The system will allow users to browse available events, select seats, make
payments, and receive e-tickets. It will also provide an administrative interface for managing
events, venues, and user bookings.
3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: None
2. **System Overview**
1. System Architecture: The system will be a web-based application built using a three-tier
architecture (presentation layer, application layer, and data layer).
2. System Interfaces: The system will have interfaces for users, administrators, and external
payment gateways.
3. User Characteristics: The system will cater to two types of users: regular users who book
tickets and administrators who manage the system.
4. Constraints: The system should be responsive, secure, and scalable to handle a large
number of concurrent users.
3. **Functional Requirements**
1. User Registration and Login
- Users should be able to register an account with the system by providing their details.
- Users should be able to log in to their accounts using their credentials.
2. Event Management
- Administrators should be able to add, update, and delete events.
- Events should have attributes such as title, description, date, time, venue, and available
seats.
3. Ticket Booking
- Users should be able to browse available events and view event details.
- Users should be able to select seats and specify the quantity of tickets.
- Users should be able to add tickets to their shopping cart.
- Users should be able to proceed to checkout and make payments.
4. Payment Processing
- The system should integrate with external payment gateways to process payments
securely.
- Payment options should include credit/debit card, net banking, and mobile wallets.
5. Ticket Generation
- Once payment is successful, the system should generate e-tickets containing event details
and a unique booking reference.
- E-tickets should be emailed to the user and stored in their account for future reference.
6. Booking Management
- Administrators should be able to view and manage user bookings.
- Administrators should be able to cancel or refund tickets if required.
7. Reporting and Analytics
- The system should provide reports and analytics on ticket sales, revenue, and popular
events.
4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. Usability: The system should have an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate and
understand.
2. Performance: The system should be responsive and handle concurrent user requests
efficiently.
3. Security: The system should implement secure authentication, protect user data, and use
encryption for sensitive information.
4. Reliability: The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime for maintenance.
5. Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and
events.
6. Compatibility: The system should be compatible with major web browsers and devices.
7. Maintainability: The system should be easy to maintain and support future enhancements.
5. **System Models**
- Use Case Diagram: (Provide a use case diagram illustrating the interactions between users
and the system
)
- Class Diagram: (Provide a class diagram representing the classes/entities and their
relationships)
- Sequence Diagram: (Provide a sequence diagram depicting the flow of interactions for a
typical ticket booking process)
Now, let's move on to creating the entity diagrams to illustrate the system's entities and their
relationships.
**Entity Diagrams**
1. **Event**
- Attributes: eventID, title, description, date, time, venueID, availableSeats
- Relationships: One-to-many with Booking
2. **Venue**
- Attributes: venueID, name, address
- Relationships: One-to-many with Event
3. **User**
- Attributes: userID, name, email, password
- Relationships: One-to-many with Booking
4. **Booking**
- Attributes: bookingID, userID, eventID, numTickets, bookingDate
- Relationships: Many-to-one with User and Event
5. **Payment**
- Attributes: paymentID, bookingID, amount, paymentDate
- Relationships: One-to-one with Booking
Note: The entity diagrams provide a visual representation of the entities and their relationships.
Please note that the diagrams are simplified for illustration purposes, and additional attributes or
relationships may be required depending on your specific system requirements.
Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to provide you with a pictorial representation of
connected tables. However, you can use the provided entity diagrams as a reference to create
your own database schema, connecting the tables based on the relationships described.
I hope this helps you create a comprehensive SRS and entity diagrams for your online ticket
booking system! Let me know if you have any further questions.

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Online Project
Management System**
1. **Introduction**
1. Purpose: The purpose of the online project management system is to provide a
collaborative platform for managing and tracking projects, tasks, resources, and timelines.
2. Scope: The system will allow users to create projects, assign tasks to team members,
monitor progress, allocate resources, and generate reports. It will provide features for task
management, document sharing, communication, and scheduling.
3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: None
2. **System Overview**

architecture (presentation layer, application layer, and data layer).
2. System Interfaces: The system will have interfaces for project managers, team members,
and administrators.
3. User Characteristics: The system will cater to project managers who create and manage
projects, team members who work on tasks, and administrators who manage system settings
and user roles.

In the above diagram, the arrows indicate the relationships between the entities. The
relationships are defined as follows:
- One User can be assigned to multiple Tasks (Many-to-Many relationship through
TaskAssignment)
- One Task can be assigned to multiple Users (Many-to-Many relationship through
TaskAssignment)
- One User can create multiple Projects (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Project can have multiple Tasks (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Task can have multiple Resource Assignments (One-to-Many relationship)
- One Resource can be assigned to multiple Tasks (One-to-Many relationship)
Please note that the ER diagram provided is a simplified representation of the entities and
relationships in an online project management system. Additional attributes or relationships may
be required depending on your specific system requirements.
I hope this description helps you visualize the connections between the entities in your online
project management system.
